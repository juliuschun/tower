# Team Principles

## 1. Write it down
Don't decide verbally. Even a short note counts.
A decision not written down becomes "what did we say again?" later.

## 2. Record the why
Not just "we chose A" but "B was an option too, but we went with A because X."
So when conditions change, we can re-evaluate.

## 3. Make it findable
Writing is only half the battle — being able to find it later matters just as much.
Clear titles, consistent locations.

## 4. Start small
Don't try to write the perfect SOP.
A one-paragraph memo is 100x better than nothing.

## 5. Revisit
Writing it down isn't the end. Once a month,
just ask: "is this still right?"
